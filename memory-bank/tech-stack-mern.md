## 8. Technology Justifications

### 8.1 Why MERN stack over alternatives?
The MERN stack offers a unified JavaScript experience across the entire application. MongoDB's flexible schema is perfect for rapid iteration and adaptation to changing requirements, which is crucial for an e-commerce platform in its early stages.

### 8.2 Why MongoDB over relational databases?
MongoDB's document model aligns well with JavaScript objects, making it a natural fit for a Node.js application. Its flexible schema allows for easy adaptation as product requirements evolve, eliminating the need for complex migrations during early development stages.

### 8.3 Why Zustand over Redux?
Zustand provides a simpler and more lightweight alternative to Redux while maintaining powerful state management capabilities. It reduces boilerplate code significantly and has a more intuitive API, leading to faster development cycles and easier maintenance.

### 8.4 Why Chakra UI over other component libraries?
Chakra UI offers accessible components out of the box with a focus on developer experience. Its prop-based styling system integrates well with React's component model, and the theming capabilities allow for easy customization to match the sushi shop's branding.

### 8.5 Why React Admin for the back office?
React Admin provides a comprehensive solution for building administrative interfaces with minimal custom code. It handles common admin panel patterns like CRUD operations, filtering, and pagination, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than UI implementation.
