# Sushi Shop Clone Architecture Documentation

## Project Architecture Overview

This document explains the architecture and organization of the Sushi Shop Clone project, detailing what each file and directory does within our MERN stack implementation.

## Base Project Structure

```
/
├── client/             # Frontend React application
├── server/             # Backend Express API
├── .git/               # Git repository data
├── .gitignore          # Git ignore rules
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── memory-bank/        # Project planning and documentation
```

### Root Level Files & Directories

#### `.gitignore`

**Purpose**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

**Implementation Details**:
- Excludes dependency directories (`node_modules`)
- Ignores build outputs and distribution files
- Prevents environment variable files from being committed
- Excludes log files, IDE configurations, and OS-specific files

**Benefits**:
- Prevents committing large files that can be regenerated
- Protects sensitive information in environment variables
- Avoids conflicts from IDE-specific configuration files

#### `README.md`

**Purpose**: Provides project overview, setup instructions, and documentation.

**Implementation Details**:
- Contains project description and features
- Lists the technology stack used
- Provides setup and installation instructions
- Includes directory structure overview

**Benefits**:
- Onboards new developers quickly
- Serves as central documentation entry point
- Provides a quick reference for project information

#### `client/`

**Purpose**: Contains the frontend React application.

**Implementation Details**:
- Will house the Vite React TypeScript application
- Will follow feature-based organization for components, pages, and utilities

**Benefits**:
- Separates frontend concerns from backend
- Allows independent development and deployment
- Enables clear separation of responsibilities

#### `server/`

**Purpose**: Contains the backend Express API.

**Implementation Details**:
- Will house the Node.js/Express.js application
- Will implement controllers, models, and routes for the API

**Benefits**:
- Cleanly separates API logic from frontend
- Enables independent scaling of backend services
- Facilitates clear API development and testing

## Planned Architecture

As the project develops, this architecture will expand to include:

### Frontend Architecture

- Component-based structure using React
- State management with Zustand stores organized by domain
- API integration with React Query
- Routing with React Router v6+
- Theming and styling with Chakra UI

### Backend Architecture

- Express.js API with route versioning
- MongoDB models with Mongoose
- Authentication using Passport.js with JWT
- Middleware for security, logging, and error handling
- Controllers implementing business logic

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with React components
2. Actions trigger Zustand state updates
3. React Query manages API calls to backend
4. Express routes direct requests to controllers
5. Controllers interact with MongoDB via Mongoose models
6. Data flows back through the same path to update the UI

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the scalable, maintainable MERN stack application we're building for the Sushi Shop Clone project.
