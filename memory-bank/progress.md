# Sushi Shop Clone Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration

### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure (Completed on May 4, 2025)

**Tasks Completed:**

1. Created project directory structure with separate client and server folders:
   - `/client` - For frontend React application
   - `/server` - For backend Express API

2. Set up Git repository with proper .gitignore file:
   - Added standard exclusions for MERN stack: node_modules, build files, environment files
   - Added IDE, OS-specific files, and logs to .gitignore

3. Updated README.md with comprehensive project information:
   - Added project overview and features
   - Documented technology stack (MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
   - Added setup instructions and prerequisites
   - Included project structure outline

### Step 2: Frontend Project Setup (Completed on May 5, 2025)

**Tasks Completed:**

1. Generated Vite React TypeScript project in the client folder with proper configuration
2. Configured ESLint and Prettier according to project standards
3. Set up folder structure following feature-based organization:
   - `/src/components` - For reusable UI components
   - `/src/pages` - For page components
   - `/src/hooks` - For custom React hooks
   - `/src/utils` - For utility functions
   - `/src/types` - For TypeScript type definitions
   - `/src/stores` - For state management (using Zustand)
   - `/src/assets` - For static assets

4. Created core product-related components:
   - ProductCard component for displaying product items
   - ProductGrid for displaying multiple products
   - ProductFilter for filtering the product list
   - ProductDetailPage for showing detailed product information
   - MenuPage for browsing products

5. Implemented shared layout components:
   - Header with navigation
   - Footer with site information
   - AppLayout as the base layout wrapper

6. Fixed various TypeScript and linting errors:
   - Resolved JSX tag mismatches in ProductDetailPage
   - Fixed prop types for Chakra UI v3 compatibility
   - Replaced Skeleton components with conditional rendering patterns
   - Corrected the addItem function call in the cart functionality
   - Removed unused imports throughout components

**Next Steps:**

- Implement the complete shopping cart functionality
- Connect to a real API for product data (currently using mock data)
- Add authentication features for user accounts
- Implement order history and checkout flow

**Notes for Future Developers:**

- The project follows a standard monorepo structure with client and server as separate packages
- See README.md for complete project setup instructions
- All environment variables will need to be configured before starting development
- Chakra UI v3 is being used which has some compatibility differences from v2 - refer to documentation when needed
- Product data is currently mocked in `/src/stores/productStore.ts`
