# Sushi Shop Frontend Implementation

## Step 9: Frontend Configuration & Dependencies

### Technologies Implemented

This step involved setting up four key frontend technologies for the Sushi Shop application:

1. **Chakra UI** - For component styling and theming
   - Configured theme with custom colors for the Sushi Shop brand
   - Applied responsive design principles using Chakra's design system
   - Theme defined in `/src/theme/index.ts`

2. **React Router v6** - For page navigation and routing
   - Implemented route configuration in `/src/routes.tsx`
   - Added lazy loading for code splitting and better performance
   - Set up error handling and nested routes

3. **Zustand** - For state management
   - Created three main stores:
     - `authStore.ts` - Authentication state (user, tokens, login/logout)
     - `cartStore.ts` - Shopping cart state (items, quantities, totals)
     - `uiStore.ts` - UI state (menu visibility, theme mode, etc.)
   - Implemented middleware (devtools, persist) for better development experience
   - Applied TypeScript for type safety

4. **React Query** - For server state management
   - Set up query client with optimal caching configuration
   - Created API hooks for categories and products in `/src/api/`
   - Implemented error handling with useApiError hook
   - Added loading states and optimistic updates

```

### Testing the Implementation

You can validate the implementation by visiting the test page:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/test`

3. The test page showcases all four technologies:
   - Chakra UI styling and theme
   - React Router navigation (shown by visiting the page)
   - Zustand state management (toggle UI state, check authentication)
   - React Query (fetch data from API with the test button)

### Next Steps

With the frontend configuration and dependencies in place, the next steps will be:

1. Create authentication components (Step 10)
2. Implement product listing and filtering 
3. Build the shopping cart functionality
4. Add checkout flow

## Development Notes

### Chakra UI Implementation

- Using Chakra UI v2 for stable component APIs
- Theme extends the default with custom colors for the Sushi Shop brand
- Added responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views

### State Management Strategy

- **Global State**: Zustand for app-wide state (auth, cart, UI)
- **Server State**: React Query for API data (products, categories)
- **Local State**: React's useState for component-specific state

All API requests use React Query's caching and invalidation, following the pattern in `/src/api/*.ts` files.
